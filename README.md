# Object-Information-Retrieval-in-Real-time

According to the World Health Organization survey from 
2021, there are 1 billion people in the world who have 
moderate or severe distance vision impairment. The 
project's main objective is to develop an android 
application for object detection for the blind. This is 
implemented for the COCO dataset, which has 80 classes 
of objects that the user will probably utilize daily. Android 
Studio is used to make the app and the UI. The model is 
trained using TensorFlow and converted into TensorFlow 
Lite. The project is carried out using a camera device on 
the client's side that records live video, converts it into 
frames, detects the objects and it's position and gives 
audio output.
